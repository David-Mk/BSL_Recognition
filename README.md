<h1>BSL Recognition(Active WIP)</h1>
This app will provide the possibility to recognise and translate Bulgarian Sign Language (or BSL for short).<br>
The current project is under development and many more changes will occur ;) Some of the ideas were implemented in my previous project (https://github.com/David-Mk/Emotion_Recognition), but this one has been refactored and improved.
