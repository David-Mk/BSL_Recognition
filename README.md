<h1>BSL Recognition (Active WIP)</h1>
This app will provide the possibility to recognise and translate Bulgarian Sign Language (or BSL for short).<br>
The current project is under development and many more changes will occur ;) Some of the ideas were implemented in my previous project (https://github.com/David-Mk/Emotion_Recognition), but this one has been refactored and improved.<br>
<ol>
    <li>Words Bulgarian-English translations are stored in <i>dictionary</i> file</li>
    <li>To access the TensorBoard, in main directory run command <i>tensorboard --logdir=.</i></li>
</ol>
